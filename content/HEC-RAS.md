1. **River Centerline (U/S to D/S):**
    - Draw the river centerline from upstream (U/S) to downstream (D/S) to represent the flow direction.
    - Ensure it follows the thalweg (deepest part of the river channel).

2. **Chainage (D/S to U/S):**
    - Chainage is measured from downstream (D/S) to upstream (U/S).
    - Stations are marked along the centerline for cross-section placement.

3. **Cross-Sections (5 Lines):**
    - Each cross-section should cross:
        - 2 flow paths (left and right),
        - 2 bank lines (left and right),
        - and the river centerline.
    - This ensures accurate representation of the river geometry and flow area.
