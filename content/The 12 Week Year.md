| 2024-04-16 | The 12 Week Year | One week at a time          | The greatest predictor of your future are your daily actions. To use your weekly plan effectively, you will need to spend the first 15 or 20 minutes at the beginning of each week to review your progress from the past week and plan the upcoming one. In addition, the first five minutes of each day should be spent reviewing your weekly plan to plan that day’s activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2024-04-17 | The 12 Week Year | Confronting the truth       | Measurement drives the execution process. Truth is the only safe ground to stand on. We urge you to strive for excellence, not perfection. We have found that if you successfully complete 85 percent of the activities in your weekly plan, then you will most likely achieve your objectives. Remember that your plan contains the top priorities that will add the most value and have the greatest impact. In other words, you only need to be 85 percent effective on the top priorities to achieve excellence! Productive tension is the uncomfortable feeling you get when you’re not doing the things you know you need to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 2024-04-19 | The 12 Week Year | Accountability as Ownership | Everything we do in life is a choice. Accountability is not consequences; it’s ownership. At the end of the day, the only accountability that truly exists is self-accountability. The only person who can hold you accountable for anything is you, and to be successful you must develop the mental honesty and courage to own your thinking, actions, and results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
