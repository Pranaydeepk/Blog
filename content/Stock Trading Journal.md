### Trading Rationale

The strategy of setting a 10% profit target and limiting to one trade per day is designed to balance profit realization with risk management. This approach ensures that profits are secured without holding onto stocks too long, while preventing over-trading and reducing emotional decision-making. The target of achieving 2.5 times the previous month's profit reflects a growth-oriented strategy, which should be realistic and aligned with market conditions. Continuous monitoring, adaptability to market changes, and maintaining emotional discipline are crucial for the success of this strategy.
