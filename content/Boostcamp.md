I have decided to join Boostcamp because I am looking for a well-structured and scientifically-proven fitness program that aligns with my goal of gaining muscle and improving my overall health. Boostcamp's approach of combining traditional weightlifting principles with modern scientific methods aligns with my fitness philosophy.

As of April 9th, 2024, my starting weight was 62.1kg. I am currently following the [[Super Squats]] program, which claims to help individuals gain 30lbs (13.6kg) in just 6 weeks. I am excited to try it out and see the results.
