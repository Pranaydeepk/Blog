My mornings begin with a curated playlist of music videos on YouTube titled "[Good Morning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhiADRAs3DOKpFSed7ZCkLA3oYwNWXFQN)," which serves as my personal collection of morning anthems. This is followed by my daily commitment to "[[Cultivating a Reading Habit - 30 Days, 30 Chapters Challenge]]." To energize myself further, I then turn to "[POWERFUL DMT Wim Hof Breathing - 40s Breath holds (3 Guided Rounds) on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2wBCGOLFw4).
